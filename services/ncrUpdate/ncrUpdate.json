    "originalText": "v Clinical Features Dravet syndrome, previously known as ‘severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy’ (SMEI), is an epileptic syndrome characterized by normal development before onset, seizures beginning in the first year of life in the form of generalized or unilateral febrile clonic seizures, secondary appearance of myoclonic seizures, and occasionally partial seizures. It is associated with ataxia, slowed psychomotor development, and mental decline, and is often refractory to medication (Dravet et al., 1992; Sugawara et al., 2002). @ Renier and Renkawek (1990) reported that an autopsy of a 19-month-old boy with SMEI showed microdysgenesis of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex as well as malformation of the spinal cord. @ Doose et al. (1998) reported a large group of patients with severe intractable epilepsy of infancy or childhood with frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At onset, the disorder was characterized by prolonged febrile and afebrile seizures as the only seizure type. With advancing age, the symptomatology became increasingly polymorphic due to additional seizure types, such as complex or focal. The most common triggering feature was fever or immersion in a hot bath, and most patients had severe impairment of mental development after seizure onset. Doose et al. (1998) noted. the phenotypic overlap with SMEI. @ ",
