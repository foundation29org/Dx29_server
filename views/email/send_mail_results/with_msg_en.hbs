<p>We are a non-profit organisation that designs and creates tools for patients to manage their own data, revolutionising the diagnosis and management of rare diseases. We empower patients and doctors to use their medical data or their benefit and that of the community. We believe there is a better way to do things centred on the patient and their data.</p>
