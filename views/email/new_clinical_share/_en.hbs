<p>Hello,</p>
<p>{{patientName}} wants you to help them find a diagnosis and that's why they share their data with you through <a href="https://www.dx29.ai/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=patient_physician&utm_campaign=data_sharing">Dx29</a>. You will find their medical reports, their list of symptoms standardized according to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and, if available, genetic data. In Dx29 you can analyze them to see which rare diseases fit with them.</p>
<p>
With Dx29 we want to accelerate the diagnosis of rare diseases. Your patient is using it to keep their information organized and structured, so they can share it with you. Dx29 is a free website where the collected data remains controlled by the patient. It is created by Foundation 29, a non-profit foundation that wants rare disease patients to find a diagnosis as soon as possible.
